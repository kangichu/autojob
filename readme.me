AutoJob is a comprehensive desktop application designed to streamline and automate your job search and application process. With AutoJob, you can search for jobs across multiple platforms—including Indeed, Glassdoor, CareerBuilder, Google Jobs, BrighterMonday, Remote OK, and We Work Remotely—using advanced web scraping powered by Selenium.
